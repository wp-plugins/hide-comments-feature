If you do not need Comments functionality in your Wordpress instance, you can "hide" it with this plugin.



== Description ==

For those who do not need to have the Comments feature in them WordPress installation (for various reasons), this plugin completely removes any trace of the existence of this feature in the administration interface.
Completely done through techniques based on a combination of jQuery and URL.
Requires no configuration, just install and any trace of Comments disappears.
This does not modify the core, so it is an "upgrade-safe".


== Installation ==

1. Upload `hide-comments-feature` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this affect my Wordpress Instalation? =
No. It is an upgrade-safe plugin that does not affect the core. In other words, the feature still exists there but it is hidden.

= And about my theme? Comments still there... =
Off course! The purpose of this plugin is to help Web designers to create sites with Wordpress that do not need the comments functionality.
For this reason, Web designers create Themes without putting control methods for the comments on them. Thus they can ensure that their customers will no longer see mentioned the word "Comment".
If you want to remove the comments from your Theme the best you can do is to edit it and remove any methods that may exist.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Comments button has gone!
